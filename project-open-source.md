## Working on open-source projects related to virtualization

Students learn a lot from doing the open-source project, but it takes
a lot of time to set up. Start work on this early!

Check out these Github repositories. See the issues and the "help
wanted" tag. 

You can also politely email the developers to ask about
appropriate projects: the last version of the class had success with
this approach. There are some awesome developers out there :)
