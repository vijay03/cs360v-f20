Serverless
Lets say you have a function (that talks to a server-side database)
that needs to be triggered every time a user visits a web page. 
The normal way to do this is to run a web server on the server side,
use a framework like Ruby on Rails to implement your logic, and
present the results in a web page to the user
This requires that:
You need a physical machine (or an EC2-like instance) to run your web
server on
You need to run the whole operating system + web server stack on this
machine
If the traffic increases, you might have to do the whole thing on
another machine
Problems:
Servers are underutilized
Hard to scale
Managing an entire OS for a service is hard
Now, containers help with this problem by only requiring developers to
create containers instead of full VMs, but the other problems remain:
You need to run/rent a cluster to run your containers on
If all you wanted was to run a single function in response to a user
request, it still seems like overkill
Serverless is the next stop along the road to making all of this more
efficient and convenient
With Serverless,
You focus on the application logic
You don’t care which server or instance it is deployed on (it is
invisible to you)
The infrastructure automatically scales for you, running as many
instances of your function as required
Running a function could *potentially* be faster than instantiating
and running a new container
You only pay for the time the function is executing, not the time the
stack is sitting around un-utilized 
Each Serveless function is triggered by an event that you configure
Key difference between different paradigms:
Traditional: manage servers + server applications
VMs: manage VMs + server applications + physical/virtual cluster
(optional)
Containers: manage containers + server applications (inside
containers) + physical/virtual cluster (optional)
Serverless: manage functions (nothing else, not even server
applications)
Serverless provided by all major providers now: Amazon web services,
Microsoft Azure, IBM OpenWhisk, Google Cloud Platform
Amazon Serverless is called Lambda
Amazon free tier provides 1 million lambda requests per month!
Not all applications fit the Serverless Paradigm:
The function that is triggered cannot have its own state (it may be
running on a different machine or instance each time). All its state
needs to be external. This is the same problem that containers face,
but more extreme
If a function is invoked twice in the same container process, the
second invocation has access to state left behind by the first. Not so
for serverless functions
If your function is long-running and frequently triggered, it would
actually be more cost-effective just to provision an always-on server
on it
Multiple copies of the function needs to be able to run in parallel
(more on this below)
Good example of Serverless function: authentication
Send username + key to backend, authenticate, get back response
If this is triggered at a low frequency, say once an hour, doesn’t
make sense to have a server run just on authentication
Why don’t we simply run multiple services in a single server instance?
We are coupling together different services on a single hardware
instance
This makes it harder to scale
For example, if you have service A and service B on a machine, and
service B alone gets a lot more traffic, do you now replicate both A
and B onto a new machine? 
The client application or website has to be modified to use serverless
It is now tracking the session and the requests sent out to various
serverless services
The client application thus becomes more complex
How is Serverless implemented on the backend?
Using containers!
The infrastructure provider creates and runs containers
Developers have to write serverless functions carefully:
Have to assume multiple instances of the function are running
The infrastructure may do this if there is demand
For example, code that acquires a big lock each time the function is
run will be extremely bad for this architecture
API Gateway
This allows a function to be triggered in response to an incoming HTTP
request
Function startup times on AWS Lambda:
10-100 ms for a Python or Javascript function
>100 ms (sometimes several seconds) for a Java function (need to start
the JVM)
